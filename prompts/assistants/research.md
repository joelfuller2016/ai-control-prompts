# Research Prompts

These prompts are designed to help you use AI for research tasks, information gathering, summarization, and analysis.

### Title: Literature Review Assistant
**Tags**: research, literature-review, academic, summarization  
**Prompt**: "I'm researching [TOPIC] and need help conducting a structured literature review. For each of the following papers/articles, please:

1. Summarize the key findings, methodology, and conclusions (3-5 bullet points per paper)
2. Identify the theoretical frameworks or models being used
3. Note any limitations or gaps acknowledged by the authors
4. Extract key quotes that capture the essence of the research
5. Suggest how this paper connects to or contradicts other papers in this list

After analyzing each individual paper, please:
1. Synthesize the overall state of knowledge in this area
2. Identify common themes, contradictions, or debates in the literature
3. Highlight gaps that future research could address
4. Suggest a conceptual framework that integrates these findings

Here are the papers/articles to analyze:
[LIST OF PAPERS/ARTICLES]"

### Title: Data Analysis and Insights Generator
**Tags**: research, data-analysis, insights, pattern-recognition  
**Prompt**: "I have the following dataset about [TOPIC/DOMAIN]:

[PROVIDE DATA OVERVIEW OR SAMPLE]

Please help me analyze this data by:

1. Suggesting key questions we could answer with this dataset
2. Identifying potential patterns, trends, or anomalies to investigate
3. Recommending specific analyses we should run (statistical tests, correlations, segmentations, etc.)
4. Pointing out potential limitations or biases in the data
5. Suggesting additional data points that would strengthen our analysis if collected

Once we agree on the approach, please guide me through interpreting the results by explaining what they mean in plain language, their implications, and what actions they might suggest."

### Title: Comparative Analysis Framework
**Tags**: research, comparison, analysis, decision-making  
**Prompt**: "I need to conduct a thorough comparative analysis of the following [PRODUCTS/CONCEPTS/APPROACHES]:

[LIST ITEMS TO COMPARE]

Please create a comprehensive comparison framework that:

1. Identifies the most relevant criteria for comparison (8-12 key factors)
2. Evaluates each option against these criteria with evidence-based assessments
3. Highlights the key strengths and weaknesses of each option
4. Creates a weighted scoring system based on my priorities: [LIST PRIORITIES]
5. Includes both quantitative metrics and qualitative considerations
6. Visualizes the comparison in an easily digestible format
7. Provides a nuanced conclusion about which option(s) might be best suited for different scenarios or objectives

Format this as a structured report I can use for decision-making."

### Title: Trend Analysis and Future Prediction
**Tags**: research, trends, forecasting, future-analysis  
**Prompt**: "I need to understand the current state, recent developments, and future trajectory of [INDUSTRY/FIELD/TECHNOLOGY]. Please provide a comprehensive trend analysis that includes:

1. Historical context: Key milestones and developments in the past 5-10 years
2. Current state analysis: Major players, technologies, approaches, and market dynamics
3. Emerging trends: Early signals of change and innovation (identify at least 5-7 distinct trends)
4. Potential future scenarios: 3-4 plausible futures for this field over the next 3-5 years, including:
   - Key drivers and assumptions for each scenario
   - Implications for various stakeholders
   - Early indicators to watch for that would signal movement toward each scenario
5. Expert perspectives: Summarize what leading thinkers and organizations in this space are predicting
6. Blind spots: What potential disruptions or paradigm shifts might be underappreciated

Present this information in a well-structured format with section headers and emphasize evidence-based insights rather than speculation."
