# AI Control Prompts: User Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you effectively utilize the structured prompts in the `ai-control-prompts` repository. These prompts are designed to provide clear instructions to AI models and agents across various platforms, helping you achieve more consistent, useful, and targeted responses.

## What Are AI Control Prompts?

AI control prompts are carefully crafted instructions that guide AI models to produce specific types of outputs. They act as templates that you can customize for your particular needs. A well-designed prompt increases the likelihood of getting the exact type of response you want from an AI system.

## How to Use This Repository

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by categories and use cases:

```
/ai-control-prompts
├── prompts/
│   ├── index.json            # Master index with tags and descriptions
│   ├── assistants/           # Prompts for different assistant roles
│   │   ├── productivity.md   # Task and time management prompts
│   │   ├── coding.md         # Software development prompts
│   │   └── research.md       # Information gathering prompts
│   ├── tools/                # Prompts for specific tools
│   │   ├── github.md         # GitHub automation prompts
│   │   └── shell.md          # Command-line automation prompts
```

### Using a Prompt

Each prompt in the repository follows this format:

```md
### Title: [Prompt Name]
**Tags**: [relevant-tags]
**Prompt**: "[The actual prompt text with placeholders]"
```

To use a prompt:

1. Browse the repository to find a prompt that matches your needs
2. Copy the text in the **Prompt** section
3. Replace any placeholders (text in [BRACKETS]) with your specific information
4. Submit the completed prompt to your AI tool of choice

### Customizing Prompts

While these prompts are designed to work well out of the box, you may want to customize them for your specific needs:

- **Add context**: Provide additional background information relevant to your situation
- **Adjust tone**: Modify language to match your preferred communication style
- **Extend functionality**: Add additional requirements or constraints
- **Combine prompts**: Merge elements from multiple prompts for complex tasks

## Prompt Categories

### Assistant Prompts

These prompts instruct AI to take on specific assistant roles:

#### Productivity Assistant
Use these prompts when you need help with task management, scheduling, focus, and project planning. Examples include daily planning, weekly reviews, focus sessions, and project breakdowns.

#### Coding Assistant
These prompts help with software development tasks such as code refactoring, pair programming, algorithm design, and documentation generation.

#### Research Assistant
Use these when you need help with information gathering, analysis, and synthesis. Examples include literature reviews, data analysis, comparative frameworks, and trend analysis.

### Tool-Specific Prompts

These prompts help you use AI to control specific tools and platforms:

#### GitHub Automation
These prompts help with repository setup, pull request reviews, GitHub Actions workflows, and issue management.

#### Shell/Command Line
Use these prompts for file operations, system monitoring, data processing pipelines, and development environment setup.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of these prompts, follow these recommendations:

1. **Be specific**: The more details you provide in your placeholders, the better results you'll get
2. **Start broad, then refine**: Begin with a general prompt, then iterate with more specific instructions
3. **Provide examples**: When possible, include examples of the output you're looking for
4. **Set constraints**: Clearly state any limitations or requirements for the response
5. **Review and iterate**: Evaluate the AI's output and refine your prompt if necessary

## Common Customization Placeholders

Throughout the prompts, you'll find common placeholders to customize:

- `[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]`: Details about your project or task
- `[LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]`: Programming language or technical framework
- `[CONSTRAINTS]`: Specific limitations or requirements
- `[PRIORITIES]`: Your most important objectives
- `[TIME_PERIOD]`: Relevant timeframes

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Chain of Prompts
For complex tasks, consider using multiple prompts in sequence, where the output of one prompt becomes input for the next.

### Prompt Versioning
Keep track of which versions of prompts work best for your needs and iterate accordingly.

### AI-Specific Adaptations
Different AI systems may respond differently to the same prompt. You might need to adjust based on the specific AI tool you're using.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting the results you want:

- **Too general?** Add more specific details and examples
- **Too complex?** Break your request into smaller, simpler prompts
- **Incorrect focus?** Clearly state your priorities and desired outcomes
- **Inconsistent results?** Add more structure and constraints to your prompt
